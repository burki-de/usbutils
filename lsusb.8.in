.SH NAME
lsusb \- list USB devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsusb
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lsusb
is a utility for displaying information about USB buses in the system and
the devices connected to them.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Tells
.I lsusb
to be verbose and display detailed information about the devices shown.
This includes configuration descriptors for the device's current speed.
Class descriptors will be shown, when available, for USB device classes
including hub, audio, HID, communications, and chipcard. Can be used with the
\fBt\fP option.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP [[\fIbus\fP]\fB:\fP][\fIdevnum\fP]
Show only devices in specified
.I bus
and/or
.I devnum.
Both ID's are given in decimal and may be omitted.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP [\fIvendor\fP]\fB:\fP[\fIproduct\fP]
Show only devices with the specified vendor and product ID.
Both ID's are given in hexadecimal.
.TP
.B \-f \fIFORMAT\fP
Change format of device list (not with \-D):
%b = bus number, %d = device number,
%v = vendor ID, %i = product ID,
%m = vendor name, %p = produce name,
%s = serial number, %x = serial as hex dump,
%% = literal %, %t = tab, %n = newline.
.TP
.B \-D \fIdevice\fP
Do not scan the /dev/bus/usb directory,
instead display only information
about the device whose device file is given.
The device file should be something like /dev/bus/usb/001/001.
This option displays detailed information like the \fBv\fP option;
you must be root to do this.
.TP
.B \-t
Tells
.I lsusb
to dump the physical USB device hierarchy as a tree. Verbosity can be increased twice with
\fBv\fP option.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print version information on standard output,
then exit successfully.

.SH RETURN VALUE
If the specified device is not found, a non-zero exit code is returned.

.SH EXAMPLE
.TP
.B lsusb -f 'Bus %b Device %d: ID %v:%i %m %p%n'
is the same as standard output format.
.TP
.B lsusb -d 0483:3748 -f '%b:%d %x %p%n'
List only this kind of device with bus and device number and hexadecimal dump of serial number.
Some devices (e.g. ST-LINK/V2) has binary data in serial number string. Serial number string is in UTF-16 format.
With ASCII encoding every second hex byte is 00.
